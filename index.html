            This page provides an analysis of car prices in Australia,
            showcasing various trends related to different car models, regions,
            and vehicle attributes. The visualisations below explore key
            insights, including the distribution of car types by location, car
            registration trends, and pricing patterns by year.

                    <strong>Visualisation 1:</strong> This visualisation
                    displays the distribution of car prices across different
                    regions of Australia. It allows for a quick comparison of
                    how prices vary by postcode, giving insight into regional
                    pricing differences. These trends can help buyers or sellers
                    understand the impact of location on car prices.

                    <strong>Fuel Consumption vs. Price:</strong> Hatchbacks
                    consistently have the best fuel economy due to their smaller
                    size and lighter weight. SUVs offer decent fuel economy
                    despite their larger size, thanks to modern engineering and
                    fuel-saving technologies. Sedans tend to have lower fuel
                    efficiency because many are built for higher performance or
                    sportier driving experiences, prioritising power over fuel
                    savings. A similar observation can be made for higher priced
                    vehicles. This pattern suggests that vehicle design and
                    intended use play a significant role in fuel economy
                    outcomes.

                    <strong>Visualisation 3:</strong> This graph shows the
                    distribution of car types (e.g., sedan, SUV, hatchback) and
                    their prices across various years. It highlights pricing
                    trends over time and the popularity of different car types,
                    which can assist in predicting future market shifts.
